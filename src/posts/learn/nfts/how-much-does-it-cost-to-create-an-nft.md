If you choose the right platform (website/application) and right blockchain, creating an NFT can be virtually free!

On Hodl My Moon, there are no minting fee and gas fees on Polygon are less than a cent.

## What costs do I definitely have to pay?
At the time of minting an NFT you will have to pay a transaction fee to the maintainers of the blockchain called 'gas'.

## Is gas expensive?
If you pick the right blockchain, gas is not expensive.

In fact, it usually costs less than a cent on Polygon.

Gas on Ethereum on the other hand can cost tens to hundreds of dollars if you transact on a busy day in a bull market!

## So gas fluctuates depending on how busy the network is?
Yes, that's correct. You could pay more gas at busy times.

You can also voluntarily pay more gas to speed up a transaction.

Transactions are extremely fast on Polygon though, so you won't need to 'speed them up'

## What's a transaction?
When you mint an NFT, a transaction takes place to update the state of the blockchain.

You see your NFT lives on the blockchain, which is like a big shared programmable database or network.

To make changes to this database you pay gas to the maintainers of the network.

## Back to NFT costs
Aside from gas, you may pay the minting DApp a fee to use their minting facility.

This will be shown on the confirm transaction screen, if there is one.

Hodl My Moon does not charge a minting fee.

## So, I might pay a minting fee and i'll have to pay a gas fee
Yes, that's correct.

(On Hodl My Moon, there's no minting fee and gas fees on polygon are less than a cent.)

## So I'll pay less than a cent if I mint a Polygon NFT on Hodl My Moon
Yeah, that's correct, its very cheap. 

## Do you have anything more 'concrete' I can look at, I'm still a bit skeptical?
We do indeed!

Here's a 90 second video showing us [minting an NFT on Hodl My Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KBwFxOjowc)

As you can see, there's no fee and the gas price was 0.006907 Matic, which at the time of writing is $0.0062 USD, which is less than a cent.

## What about 'gasless' minting?
Some platforms have allowed 'gasless' or 'lazy minting'.

This works a bit like drop shipping.

You give the platform your content for the NFT to store in their database. 

They then list your "NFT" on their marketplace and if someone buys it they'll mint a real NFT with the content you gave them beforehand at the time of the sale.

## That's good isn't it?
If you only care about selling, **and** the blockchain you want to use has high gas fees (Ethereum), then it's an option I guess.

If you want to *actually own* an NFT though, and share it on other NFT platforms then you should mint it at creation time.

More so, if the blockchain you use charges less than a cent for gas then it makes little sense to defer minting. (Polygon)

## How do I get started?
If you've watched the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KBwFxOjowc), you can see minting on Hodl My Moon is very quick, easy, and virtually free (less than a cent).
